# Personal Holiday Planner Agent

## 📌 Overview
The **Personal Holiday Planner Agent** is an intelligent automation workflow that helps you plan your holidays effortlessly.  
It integrates multiple tools to check weather conditions, update your calendar, manage trip details, and send personalized notifications — all in one flow.

## 🚀 Why I Built This
Planning a trip usually involves juggling multiple apps and checking endless details.  
I created this agent to automate the process — from checking the weather to booking your schedule — so you can focus on enjoying your holiday rather than organizing it.
